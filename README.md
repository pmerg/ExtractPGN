## Summary

Chessgames and TWIC provide mechanism for accessing the latest chess games. Unfortunatley, both sites are reluctant to offer a single PGN file for the games without premium membership.

This project provides simple Python scripts to merge the games into a single PGN file. It is simple, quick and free.
