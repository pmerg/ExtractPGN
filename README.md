## Summary

Chessgames provides mechanism for accessing the latest chess games. Unfortunatley, the site is reluctant to offer a single PGN file for the games without premium membership.

This project provides simple Python scripts to merge the games into a single PGN file. It is simple, quick and free.

[SmallChess](http://www.smallchess.com) uses this project to generate PGN files for it's apps.
